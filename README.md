# Etch A Sketch #

[Live Demo](https://pataskad.github.io/etch-a-sketch/?#)

This project is apart of 'The Odin Project' curriculum and its purpose is to demonstrate DOM manipulation through the use of raw Javascript.  The project outline is to create a box filled with a 16x16 grid of square divs using Javascript.  This project will emphasize using the 'hover' effect to accomplish the said project outline as well as inline-block over other options such as float/clear, flexbox and CSS grid. 

This project emphasizes and encapsulates many of the JavaScript concepts I have been working on and studying over the last few months in a fun game (Etch-A-Sketch), this game includes a reset button which upon clicking will pop up a modal user input panel with input restrictions added allow for a user to dynamically adjust the amount of grid squares that are present while remaining within the set pixel height and width parameters.
