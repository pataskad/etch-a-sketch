# Etch A Sketch #

This project is apart of 'The Odin Project' curriculum and its purpose is to demonstrate DOM manipulation through the use of raw Javascript.  The project outline is to create a box filled with a 16x16 grid of square divs using Javascript.  This project will emphasize using the 'hover' effect to accomplish the said project outline as well as inline-block over other options such as float/clear, flexbox and CSS grid.
